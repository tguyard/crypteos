# Module for locating the CryptoPP encryption library.
# 
# Cutomizable variables:
#   CRYPTOPP_ROOT_DIR
#     This variable points to the CryptoPP root directory. On Windows the
#     library location typically will have to be provided explicitly using the
#     -D command-line option. The directory should include the include/cryptopp,
#     lib and/or bin sub-directories.
#
# Read-Only variables:
#   CRYPTOPP_FOUND
#     Indicates that the library has been found.
#
#   CRYPTOPP_INCLUDE_DIR
#     Points to the CryptoPP include directory.
#
#   CRYPTOPP_LIBRARIES
#     Points to the CryptoPP libraries that should be passed to
#     target_link_libararies.
